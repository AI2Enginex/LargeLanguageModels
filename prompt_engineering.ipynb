      " Consumer spending: What people spend on goods and services\n",
      " Business investment: What businesses spend on new equipment, buildings, and inventory\n",

      "\n",
      "Why is GDP Important?\n",
      "\n",
      "GDP is an important economic indicator because it:\n",
      "\n",
      " Measures the size of a country's economy\n",
      " Shows how fast the economy is growing or shrinking\n",
