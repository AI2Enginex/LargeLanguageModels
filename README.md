# Getting Started with LLM using Python

üìù Summarization: Ever wanted to distill lengthy articles into bite-sized summaries? We'll kick things off by diving into text summarization using Python's pipeline function. Learn how LLMs can condense information without losing its essence.

üîç Classification: Curious about categorizing text automatically? We'll walk through basic text classification tasks using the same pipeline function. From news articles to sentiment analysis, discover how LLMs can accurately classify text with just a few lines of code.

üåü Zero-shot Classification: Zero-shot classification allows LLMs to categorize text into predefined categories, even without specific training data. Learn how this powerful technique opens up new possibilities for classification tasks.

## üéØ Prompt Examples

***We‚Äôve designed a collection of versatile prompt templates to control LLM behavior for specific use cases:***

    Document-Based Prompt Templates:
    Keyword Extraction Prompt:
    Ensures answers are strictly based on the document content without assumptions or external knowledge. Perfect for precise fact extraction and document Q&A tasks.
    
    Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt:
    Guides the model to reason step by step, logically analyzing provided context before deriving a clear, elaborated answer. Ideal for tasks requiring deep logical reasoning, explanation, or breakdown.
    
    Verification Prompt:
    Focused on fact verification. The model checks if the answer is directly supported by the provided document. Great for compliance, fact-checking, or source-backed responses.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Role-Based Prompt Templates (Act As Prompts):

***These prompts allow you to simulate various "roles" for specific scenarios:***

    Act as Content Creator (ActasRole):
    Generates creative and engaging tweets based on a given topic.
    Use case: Social media automation or content marketing.
    
    Act as Financial Advisor (ActasAdvisor):
    Explains financial concepts in simple, beginner-friendly language.
    Use case: Financial literacy apps, personal finance assistants.
    
    Act as Translator (ActasTranslator):
    Three separate prompts for translating sentences from English to German, French, and Hindi respectively.
    Use case: Multilingual chatbots, translation services.
    
    Act as Travel Guide (ActasGuide):
    Provides top 3 specific activities to do in any travel location, formatted as bullet points.
    Use case: Travel recommendation engines, itinerary planners.

## üè∑Ô∏è Sentiment Classification Prompt Templates:

    Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification (ZeroShotSentimentClassification):
    Classifies the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of an input sentence without requiring prior labeled examples.
    Use case: Quick sentiment analysis where no training data exists.
    
    Few-Shot Sentiment Classification (FewShotSentimentClassification):
    Provides a few labeled examples before asking the model to classify a new sentence.
    Use case: Sentiment analysis tasks needing higher accuracy with example-based learning.

As we progress, we'll delve deeper into fine-tuning models, exploring domain-specific applications, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs. Stay tuned for more tutorials and tips!
