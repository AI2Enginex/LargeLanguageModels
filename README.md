# Getting Started with LLM using Python

üìù Summarization: Ever wanted to distill lengthy articles into bite-sized summaries? We'll kick things off by diving into text summarization using Python's pipeline function. Learn how LLMs can condense information without losing its essence.

üîç Classification: Curious about categorizing text automatically? We'll walk through basic text classification tasks using the same pipeline function. From news articles to sentiment analysis, discover how LLMs can accurately classify text with just a few lines of code.

üåü Zero-shot Classification: Zero-shot classification allows LLMs to categorize text into predefined categories, even without specific training data. Learn how this powerful technique opens up new possibilities for classification tasks.

As we progress, we'll delve deeper into fine-tuning models, exploring domain-specific applications, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs. Stay tuned for more tutorials and tips!
